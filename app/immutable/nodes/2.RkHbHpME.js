        We provide a safe haven for abused and neglected animals, and care for injured and orphaned native birds.</b></p> <p>Our 32 acre property has paddocks and barns to care for abused farm animals. 
        Some stay forever, and others are rehomed when they recover. 
        We&#39;re bordered by 400 acres of protected bush where we can safely release rehabilitated native birds.</p> <p>We often care for between 100 – 300 animals at The Animal Sanctuary: two-legged and
        four-legged, native and exotic, warm and cold-blooded – all getting the care that they deserve.</p> <p class="text-center"><b>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13F_Em_z83E" target="_blank" class="in-text-link">watch our video</a>
