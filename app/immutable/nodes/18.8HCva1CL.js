If we find them a sponsor, they can go to Cow Care to live out their full life.  
        Cow Care provides all the facilities to care for cows for the rest of their lives: beautiful grazing on a huge property, 
        they&#39;re moved to fresh grass every day, weighed regularly, checked on daily, given supplements, baylage in winter if necessary, annual vaccination, etc. etc. etc.</b></p> <p class="custom-wrap-text">The cost to sponsor a cow is $15 per week.  That&#39;s less than some places charge just for grazing, with no individual care for the animals. 
        As a sponsor you can visit your cow; receive reports, photos &amp; updates about your cow; join our private FB sponsors page; 
        receive invites to private Cow Care functions such as picnics, etc.</p> <p class="custom-wrap-text">If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;d love to chat with you to provide the full story, and answer any questions. 
        Please <a href="contact" class="in-text-link">CONTACT US</a> with your name and phone number, and I&#39;ll give you a call. Thank you.  
        (Note, if you&#39;re a private owner that wants to place your own cows at Cow Care, that&#39;s great!  Let me know that and I&#39;ll send you a flyer.)</p> <hr/> <div class="text-end"><a href="help" class="btn custom-btn-help-back">Back to Donate/Help</a></div></div>`;return{c(){a=u(),e=d("div"),e.innerHTML=r,this.h()},l(t){m("svelte-9m00c4",document.head).forEach(n),a=v(t),e=w(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-1jyqqak"&&(e.innerHTML=r),this.h()},h(){document.title="Cow Care - sponsor a rescue cow | The Animal Sanctuary",y(e,"class","container custom-content shadow-lg")},m(t,s){i(t,a,s),i(t,e,s)},p:o,i:o,o,d(t){t&&(n(a),n(e))}}}class b extends h{constructor(a){super(),p(this,a,null,g,l,{})}}export{b as component};
