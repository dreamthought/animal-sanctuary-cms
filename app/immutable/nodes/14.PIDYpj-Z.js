        I won’t dwell on that, because they sure don’t! Now that they’re free and healthy, have acres of safe paddock to graze, 
        multiple barns for shelter, daily treats, a favourite spot under shady trees, are shorn, wormed and hooves trimmed 
        at least 3 times a year, and receiving lots of love….they’re sooo happy!
