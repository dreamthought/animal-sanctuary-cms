            Under New Zealand law, all vets are required to provide emergency care to native birds free of charge. 
            If the assessment is positive, please contact your local bird rescue centres where it can go for continued treatment and rehabilitation.

The best way to capture them is to approach them from behind and cover them with a sheet or towel. 
            Be very careful to fold the wings carefully into the body and then lift them by the shoulders and place them into a cardboard box with air holes. 
            The three bird emergency care tips are to keep the bird quiet, dark, and warm.</div></div></div> <div class="accordion-item"><div class="accordion-header" id="headingThree"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"><h5>It’s the weekend, and I can’t get to a vet until Monday.
