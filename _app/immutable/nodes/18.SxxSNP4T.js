          Rouge was not hand-raised, so when she first came to The Sanctuary she was a notorious biter, and with that big strong beak, she attacked everything. 
          But like most of our animal residents Rouge just needed some time, love, and affection. 
          She will now call out for a hop on your shoulder, and is happy to sit with you while you read or eat, sometimes requesting something to chew on.</p> <p>Rouge is very dexterous, and unlike the other parrots, she can hold things much larger, or smaller than her. 
          It is quite impressive to see with what agility and detail she can use her claws to open nuts, tear up sticks, or rip apart toys. 
          Her favorite snack is corn on the cob, which she picks apart quite deftly and happily.</p></div></div> <hr/> <h2>Max</h2> <div class="row"><div class="col-md-3"><div class="text-center mb-2"><img src="images/animals/parrots-max.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Bartholomew the donkey"/></div></div> <div class="col-md-9"><p>Max is also an Alexandrine Parrot, and has become Rouge’s best friend. 
          He is a complete sweetheart, and the first thing he looks for in the morning is a hop on your shoulder so he can spend the day with you. 
          He is happy to step out onto your hand, and certainly enjoys a snuggle and a pat.</p> <p>Max enjoys spending sunny days in the outdoor aviary with Rouge. Parrots bond with a mate, and these two have certainly found each other. 
          Max’s favorite treat are sunflower seeds, which he opens up with his tongue and beak, no claws needed.</p></div></div> <hr/> <div class="text-end"><a class="btn btn-outline-success" href="animals" role="button">Back to Animals</a></div>`;return{c(){t=u(),e=m("div"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(a){p("svelte-8r8w30",document.head).forEach(n),t=g(a),e=v(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(e)!=="svelte-19jsolg"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){document.title="The Animal Sanctuary - Animals - Parrots",y(e,"class","container custom-content shadow-lg")},m(a,s){r(a,t,s),r(a,e,s)},p:o,i:o,o,d(a){a&&(n(t),n(e))}}}class k extends l{constructor(t){super(),c(this,t,null,f,h,{})}}export{k as component};
