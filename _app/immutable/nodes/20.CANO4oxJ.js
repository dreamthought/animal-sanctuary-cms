          We brought her to The Sanctuary to live, where she has enjoyed every minute, as you can see, by relaxing in the grass and eating to her heart’s content.</p> <p>Rosie also loves getting a tummy rub, and will stop whatever she is doing when she sees you to see if she can get one. 
          She will run over like a dog, give a piggy smile and lie down at your feet, in case you didn’t get the hint.</p></div></div> <hr/> <h2>Jose</h2> <div class="row"><div class="col-md-3"><div class="text-center mb-2"><img src="images/animals/pigs-jose.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Jose the pig"/></div></div> <div class="col-md-9"><p>We first heard about Jose when the SPCA told us they were looking for a home for a tiny kune-kune pig. 
          We went to go see little Jose, who was only a baby, and found the saddest looking animal! 
          His skin was raw and broken, his tail was bare flesh, and he was absolutely petrified. So of course, we had to have him!</p> <p>Jose required 2 weeks of intensive care before moving to The Sanctuary, but he has since grown into a healthy, happy, sociable animal. 
          In spite of his dreadful beginnings, Jose has never shown a single sign of aggression, and instead grunts hello when he first sees you – 
          probably asking for a tummy rub.</p></div></div> <hr/> <div class="text-end"><a class="btn btn-outline-success" href="animals" role="button">Back to Animals</a></div>`;return{c(){a=m(),e=g("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(s){u("svelte-16pl20e",document.head).forEach(n),a=v(s),e=p(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-7dd7pi"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){document.title="The Animal Sanctuary - Animals - Pigs",y(e,"class","container custom-content shadow-lg")},m(s,t){l(s,a,t),l(s,e,t)},p:i,i,o:i,d(s){s&&(n(a),n(e))}}}class _ extends d{constructor(a){super(),c(this,a,null,w,r,{})}}export{_ as component};
