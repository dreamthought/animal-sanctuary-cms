        So we gave our peacocks royal names: Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. 
        The human’s titles have changed since these birds arrived here many many years ago, but the peacocks’ names have remained!</p> <p>These stunning birds were rescued from a farmer that was selling his property and had decided to shoot the peacocks. 
        We immediately offered to take them, and were shocked when they arrived tied up in brown canvas sacks with only their heads poking out. 
        Thankfully, they came right and settled in with us.</p> <p>Peacocks are prolific breeders, so we took all the same gender. Over the years they have graced us constantly with their beauty. 
        We never get tired of the sun making their colours glow. 
        Prince Harry took up residence on our hot tub in the backyard, so visitors always get to enjoy his handsome good looks!</p></div></div> <div class="text-end"><a href="animals" class="btn custom-btn-animals-back">Back to Animals</a></div>`;return{c(){s=m(),e=u("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(a){v("svelte-dnk9fc",document.head).forEach(i),s=p(a),e=y(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(e)!=="svelte-1y0ucvy"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){document.title="Peacocks - Rescued Animals | The Animal Sanctuary",k(e,"class","container custom-content shadow-lg")},m(a,t){r(a,s,t),r(a,e,t)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(a){a&&(i(s),i(e))}}}class _ extends l{constructor(s){super(),h(this,s,null,f,d,{})}}export{_ as component};
