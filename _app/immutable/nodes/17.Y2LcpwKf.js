        Everyday we’d find her sitting in the nesting box on some hen’s eggs, hoping they might hatch. 
        When she first came to The Animal Sanctuary as a young chick, she was so little the other hens bullied he. 
        They treated her like an ‘ugly duckling’. But Tofu quickly outgrew them and earned top billing in their pecking order. 
        Tofu was a snuggler, and surprised visitors by being so friendly.</p> <p>When we eventually introduced other rescued turkeys as friends, 
        Tofu simply wasn’t interested. Her flock of hens was her family, and she wouldn’t abandon them! 
        Other than sitting on eggs, Tofu enjoys living the life of a free range turkey that includes scratching, 
        wandering around the sanctuary and just spending time with her hen friends..</p></div></div> <div class="text-end"><a class="btn btn-success" href="animals" role="button">Back to Animals</a></div>`;return{c(){s=u(),e=m("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){g("svelte-a0jxlj",document.head).forEach(i),s=f(t),e=y(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-1o570xj"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){document.title="The Animal Sanctuary - Animals - Tofu",v(e,"class","container custom-content shadow-lg")},m(t,a){l(t,s,a),l(t,e,a)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(t){t&&(i(s),i(e))}}}class k extends c{constructor(s){super(),d(this,s,null,T,h,{})}}export{k as component};
