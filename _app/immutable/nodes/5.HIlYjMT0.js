        Most people don’t know that ALL laying hens in New Zealand are allowed to lay for just one season, and then are killed at 18 months of age. 
        This includes free range and caged.</b></p> <p>We help rescue these young hens (with the permission of the farmers) to find them safe loving homes instead. 
        Hens make wonderful companions as they are low-maintenance, social animals that love to spend time with you and will keep you entertained with their antics.</p> <p><b><i>All of our hen rescues are now coordinated by Franklin Farm Sanctuary.</i></b> <br/>If you live in the regions of Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga, and Rotorua, please apply using this hen adoption link:
