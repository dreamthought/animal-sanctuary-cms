          We immediately offered to take four, and were shocked to receive them tied up in brown canvas sacks with only their heads poking out.</p> <p>We set them free around the property, and you can now see them poking through the bush or jumping off the roof, 
          flapping their wings and huge tails behind them. Sadly, our fourth peacock passed away recently, so Charles spends his days wandering alone, 
          looking in on the chickens and ducks and sunning himself wherever there is long grass.</p></div></div> <hr/> <h2>Prince William</h2> <div class="row"><div class="col-md-3"><div class="text-center mb-2"><img src="images/animals/peacocks-prince-william.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Bartholomew the donkey"/></div></div> <div class="col-md-9"><p>Peacocks are the national bird of India, and were once only owned by Indian maharajas, so we have given our peacocks royal names as well. 
          William, as the heir to the throne, is the most noble of the three, with a full, long set of tail feathers that he raises in full display, 
          even though we don’t have any peahens for him to impress.</p></div></div> <hr/> <h2>Prince Harry</h2> <div class="row"><div class="col-md-3"><div class="text-center mb-2"><img src="images/animals/peacocks-prince-harry.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Romeo the miniature pony"/></div></div> <div class="col-md-9"><p>Harry is the inquisitive one out of our three peacocks, and spends most of his time hanging around in the backyard,
