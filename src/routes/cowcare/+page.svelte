        <b>Rescued cows finally have an option.  If we find them a sponsor, they can go to Cow Care to live out their full life.  
        Cow Care provides all the facilities to care for cows for the rest of their lives: beautiful grazing on a huge property, 
        they're moved to fresh grass every day, weighed regularly, checked on daily, given supplements, baylage in winter if necessary, annual vaccination, etc. etc. etc.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="custom-wrap-text">
        The cost to sponsor a cow is $12 +GST per week.  That's less than some places charge just for grazing, with no individual care for the animals. 
        As a sponsor you can visit your cow; receive reports, photos & updates about your cow; join our private FB sponsors page; 
        receive invites to private Cow Care functions such as picnics, etc.

        If you're interested, I'd love to chat with you to provide the full story, and answer any questions. 
        Please <a href="contact" class="in-text-link">CONTACT US</a> with your name and phone number, and I'll give you a call. Thank you.  
        (Note, if you're a private owner that wants to place your own cows at Cow Care, that's great!  Let me know that and I'll send you a flyer.)
