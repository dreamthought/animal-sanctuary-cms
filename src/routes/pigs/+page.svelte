          When Rosie’s original family moved back to Auckland, they couldn’t bring her with them, so they left her, on her own, in a field. 
          We brought her to The Sanctuary to live, where she has enjoyed every minute, as you can see, by relaxing in the grass and eating to her heart’s content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rosie also loves getting a tummy rub, and will stop whatever she is doing when she sees you to see if she can get one. 
          She will run over like a dog, give a piggy smile and lie down at your feet, in case you didn’t get the hint.

          We first heard about Jose when the SPCA told us they were looking for a home for a tiny kune-kune pig. 
          We went to go see little Jose, who was only a baby, and found the saddest looking animal! 
          His skin was raw and broken, his tail was bare flesh, and he was absolutely petrified. So of course, we had to have him!
        </p>
        <p>
          Jose required 2 weeks of intensive care before moving to The Sanctuary, but he has since grown into a healthy, happy, sociable animal. 
          In spite of his dreadful beginnings, Jose has never shown a single sign of aggression, and instead grunts hello when he first sees you – 
          probably asking for a tummy rub.
