        <b>The Animal Sanctuary works closely with other sanctuaries to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home young hens from commercial egg farms. 
          Most people don’t know that ALL laying hens in New Zealand are allowed to lay for just one season, and then are killed at 18 months of age. 
          This includes free range and caged.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="custom-wrap-text">
          We help rescue these young hens (with the permission of the farmers) to find them safe loving homes instead. 
          Hens make wonderful companions as they are low-maintenance, social animals that love to spend time with you and will keep you entertained with their antics.
        </p>
