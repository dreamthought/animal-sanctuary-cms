        We first heard about Jose when the SPCA told us they were looking for a home for a tiny kune-kune pig. 
        We went to go see little Jose, who was only a baby, and found the saddest looking animal! 
        His skin was raw and broken, his tail was bare flesh, and he was absolutely petrified. 
        It appeared that he’d been tied up and dragged behind a vehicle. So of course, we had to have him! 
      </p>

        Jose required weeks of intensive care, but grew into a beautiful, happy, healthy and incredibly loving pig. 
        In spite of his dreadful beginnings, Jose never showed a single sign of aggression, 
        and instead greeted everyone with a soft welcoming grunt – probably asking for a tummy rub, which was his greatest delight in his wonderful long life.
