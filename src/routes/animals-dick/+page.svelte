        Dick is a domestic duck. These ducks are bred by humans for meat and down, and can’t fly. 
        Dick wandered into traffic, was hit by a car, and his beak split right down the middle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After he was brought to us - with the help of some Super Glue - his beak healed perfectly. 
          Dick enjoyed spending all his time with his best friend Dibbles – sleeping side by side in the shade of the olive trees.
          Although they were both males, they made fantastic fathers to several groups of orphaned wild ducklings 
          which they literally took under their wings. 
          Although drakes have been known to attack their young, Dick and Dibbles protected their little ones, 
          and even sat on some eggs laid by wild ducks!
