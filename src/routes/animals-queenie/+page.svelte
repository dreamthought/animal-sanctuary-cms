        Queenie is our oldest rescue hen. Despite her age, she still runs around throughout the day, 
        digging up worms and scratching in the grass for seeds. 
        Brown shavers can live up to 8-10 years of age. 
        But on all egg production farms they are slaughtered at 18 months, after laying for just one season 
        (because after each season they go “off lay” for 4 – 6 weeks while their bodies recover, before they start laying again). 
      </p>

        Thankfully Queenie has had the chance to live well into her twilight years here at The Animal Sanctuary. 
        When she goes, it will be at the end of her long, happy, well loved life.
