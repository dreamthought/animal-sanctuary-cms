          <b>The Animal Sanctuary is run by Shawn Bishop and Michael Dixon, and is based in Matakana, New Zealand.
          We provide a safe haven for abused and neglected animals, and care for injured and orphaned native birds.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our 32 acre property has paddocks and barns to care for abused farm animals. 
            Some stay forever, and others are rehomed when they recover. 
            We're bordered by 400 acres of protected bush where we can safely release rehabilitated native birds.
          </p>
          <p>
            We often care for between 100 – 300 animals at The Animal Sanctuary: two-legged and
            four-legged, native and exotic, warm and cold-blooded – all getting the care that they deserve.
          </p>
